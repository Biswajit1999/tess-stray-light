# TESS Scattered-Light Quality-Flag Audit

> **Curation:** `BUILD_FIRST` · Priority 9.0/10 · real public TESS light curves/TPFs

## Scientific question

How do TESS quality-mask policies alter flux scatter and background behaviour near scattered-light-affected cadences?

## What this repository contributes

A focused audit layer; not a replacement for Lightkurve, SPOC, QLP or MAST.

## Current state

This is a **Claude Code implementation blueprint**. The repository contains a scientific contract, data/provenance templates, starter Python package, tests, a TeX report skeleton and a React/Tailwind research-page starter. Example values are synthetic and must never be presented as mission results.

## Start here

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows PowerShell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest -q
python scripts/run_analysis.py --demo
python scripts/make_figures.py --demo
```

For the web interface:

```bash
cd web-react
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Research documentation

- `CURATION_STATUS.md`
- `docs/RESEARCH_BLUEPRINT.md`

- `docs/LITERATURE_SEEDS.md`
- `docs/VALIDATION_CONTRACT.md`

- `CLAUDE_TASK.md`

## Reproducibility and FAIR practice

All real inputs require product IDs, retrieval times, checksums, source terms and deterministic selection manifests. Derived results must record the software commit and configuration hash.

## Limitations

- The initial code is a scaffold, not a completed scientific result.
- Archive schemas and data rights must be verified before download or redistribution.
- Final literature metadata must be checked against primary sources.
- Public claims must remain narrower than the evidence.
